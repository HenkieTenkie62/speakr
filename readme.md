## Setup Instructions

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Currently, only the Docker installation method is working. The Local Development and Deployment methods are not functional at this time.

Choose either **Docker** (recommended and currently the only working method), **Local Development**, or **Deployment**.

### 1. Docker Installation

The easiest way to deploy Speakr is using Docker and docker compose.

#### Option A: Using Pre-built Docker Images

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml file:**
   ```yaml
    services:
     app:
       image: learnedmachine/speakr:latest
       container_name: speakr
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - "8899:8899"
       volumes:
         - ./uploads:/data/uploads
         - ./instance:/data/instance
       environment:
         # Database and upload folder configuration
         - SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:////data/instance/transcriptions.db
         - UPLOAD_FOLDER=/data/uploads
         
         # Text model configuration
         - TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
         - TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY=your_text_model_api_key_here
         - TEXT_MODEL_NAME=openai/gpt-4o-mini
         
         # Whisper model configuration
         - TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL=http://your_local_api_url:port/v1/
         - TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY=your_transcription_api_key_here
         - WHISPER_MODEL=Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3
         - TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE= # Optional: Specify ISO-639-1 language code (e.g., en, es, fr, zh for Chinese). Leave empty for auto-detection.
         - OUTPUT_LANGUAGE= # Optional: Specify desired language for LLM outputs (e.g., English, Spanish, Chinese). Leave empty for English default.
         
         # Application settings
         - ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false
   ```

   Alternatively, you can copy the example file:
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
   ```
   Then edit the file to update the environment variables with your actual values. **Make sure to change the mount points to the correct paths**.

2. **Start the container:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### Option A.1: Deploying with Portainer

If you're using Portainer to manage your Docker containers:

1. **In Portainer:**
   - Go to Stacks â†’ Add stack
   - Name your stack (e.g., "speakr")
   - Upload the `docker-compose.example.yml` file or paste its contents
   - Edit the environment variables with your actual values
   - Click "Deploy the stack"

2. **Important Notes for Portainer:**
   - Make sure to update all environment variables with your actual values
   - For volume persistence, you can either:
     - Use named volumes as shown in the example file
     - Or modify the volumes to use bind mounts to specific directories on your host

#### Option B: Building Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr.git
   cd speakr
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   * Copy the example docker-compose file:
     ```bash
     cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
     ```
   * Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to update the environment variables with your actual API keys and settings as described in the Configuration section.

3. **Build and Start the Container:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Create an Admin User:**
   
   You can create an admin user in one of the following ways:
   
   * **Option A: Using environment variables:**
     
     Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file:
     ```bash
     cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
     ```
     
     Edit the file to uncomment and set the admin credentials:
     ```yaml
     services:
       app:
         environment:
           - ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
           - ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
           - ADMIN_PASSWORD=securepassword
     ```
     
     Then restart the container:
     ```bash
     docker compose down
     docker compose up -d
     ```
   
   * **Option B: Using the create_admin.py script:**
     ```bash
     docker compose exec app python create_admin.py
     ```
     Follow the interactive prompts to create an admin user.

5. **Access Speakr:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8899`.

#### Customizing Data Storage

By default, all data (database and uploaded audio files) is stored in Docker volumes. To use custom directories on your host system:

1. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
   ```

2. Edit `docker-compose.override.yml` and uncomment the volume mappings:
   ```yaml
   services:
     app:
       volumes:
         - /path/to/your/uploads:/data/uploads
         - /path/to/your/database:/data/instance
   ```

3. Replace `/path/to/your/uploads` and `/path/to/your/database` with actual paths on your system.

4. Restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

#### Updating the Docker Installation

To update the application to a newer version:

1. Pull the latest code:
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. Rebuild and restart the container:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose build
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Your data will be preserved as it's stored in Docker volumes or your custom mapped directories.

### 2. Local Development

**NOTE: This method is currently not working. Please use the Docker installation method above.**

Follow these steps to run Speakr on your local machine for development or testing.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/speakr.git
    cd speakr
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Copy the example environment file `.env.example` or create a new file named `.env` in the project root.
    * Add the following variables, replacing placeholder values with your actual keys and endpoints:

        ```dotenv
        # --- Required for Summaries/Chat ---
        # (Use OpenRouter or another OpenAI-compatible Chat API)
        TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... # Your OpenRouter or compatible API key
        TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" # Or your chat model endpoint
        # Recommended Models: openai/gpt-4o-mini, google/gemini-flash-1.5, etc.
        TEXT_MODEL_MODEL_NAME="openai/gpt-4o-mini"

        # --- Required for Transcription ---
        # (Use OpenAI Whisper API or a compatible local/remote endpoint)
        TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY="cant-be-empty" # Use your OpenAI key OR often "none", "NA", "cant-be-empty" for local endpoints
        TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL="http://YOUR_LOCAL_WHISPER_IP:PORT/v1/" # Your transcription endpoint URL
        # Set the specific model name your transcription endpoint uses (if needed by API)
        WHISPER_MODEL="Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3" # Or the model your endpoint expects

        # --- Flask Specific ---
        # A strong, random secret key is crucial for session security.
        # Generate one using: python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))'
        SECRET_KEY="YOUR_VERY_STRONG_RANDOM_SECRET_KEY"

        # --- Optional ---
        # Set to 'false' to disable new user registrations
        ALLOW_REGISTRATION="true"
        ```

5.  **Database Setup & Migrations:**
    * The application uses SQLite by default, stored in `instance/transcriptions.db`.
    * If you ever need to start completely fresh, you can use `python reset_db.py`, but **be careful as this deletes all data**)

6.  **Create an Admin User:**
    * Run the interactive script to create your first user with admin privileges:
        ```bash
        python create_admin.py
        ```
    * Follow the prompts to enter a username, email, and password.

7.  **Run the Application:**
    * **Option A (Flask Development Server - recommended for local dev):**
        ```bash
        flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8899
        # Or (if flask command not found, ensure venv is active):
        # python app.py
        ```
    * **Option B (Gunicorn - closer to production):**
        ```bash
        gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8899 --timeout 600 app:app
        ```

8.  **Access Speakr:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8899` (or your server's IP address if running remotely).

### 3. Deployment (Linux with Systemd)

**NOTE: This method is currently not working. Please use the Docker installation method above.**

The `deployment/setup.sh` script automates the setup process on a Linux server using `systemd`.

**Warning:** Review the script carefully before running it, especially the paths and user (`$USER`) it assumes.

1.  **Copy Project:** Ensure all project files (including the `deployment` directory and your configured `.env` file) are on the target server.
2.  **Make Script Executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x deployment/setup.sh
    ```
3.  **Run Setup Script:**
    ```bash
    sudo bash deployment/setup.sh
    ```
    * This script will:
        * Create `/opt/transcription-app`.
        * Copy necessary files.
        * Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies.
        * Ensure `.env` exists and has a `SECRET_KEY`.
        * Create `uploads` and `instance` directories.
        * Initialize or migrate the database (`reset_db.py` on first run, `migrate_db.py` otherwise).
        * Set file ownership.
        * Create and enable a `systemd` service (`transcription.service`) to run the app with Gunicorn.
        * Start the service.
        * Prompt you to create an admin user.

4.  **Service Management:**
    * **Check Status:** `sudo systemctl status transcription.service`
    * **Stop Service:** `sudo systemctl stop transcription.service`
    * **Start Service:** `sudo systemctl start transcription.service`
    * **Restart Service:** `sudo systemctl restart transcription.service`
    * **View Logs:** `sudo journalctl -u transcription.service -f` (follow logs)
    * **View Recent Logs:** `sudo journalctl -u transcription.service -n 100 --no-pager`

5.  **Access Speakr:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8899`.

## Configuration

Configuration is primarily handled through environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file for Docker installations, or through the `.env` file for other installation methods (though note that the non-Docker installation methods are currently not working).

**Key Variables:**

* `TEXT_MODEL_BASE_URL`: **Required.** The base URL for the chat/summarization API. Defaults to OpenRouter's URL.
* `TEXT_MODEL_API_KEY`: **Required.** Your API key for the chat/summarization model endpoint (e.g., OpenRouter API Key).
* `TEXT_MODEL_NAME`: **Required.** The specific model to use for chat/summarization. **Important:** Choose a model that supports structured outputs for optimal performance. OpenAI models (GPT-4o and later) and Fireworks models are recommended. See [OpenRouter's structured outputs documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/features/structured-outputs) for more details.
* `TRANSCRIPTION_BASE_URL`: **Required.** The base URL for your transcription API endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8787/v1/`).
* `TRANSCRIPTION_API_KEY`: **Required.** Your API key for the transcription endpoint. For local endpoints, this might be a specific string like "none" or "NA". Check your endpoint's documentation.
* `WHISPER_MODEL`: *Optional.* The specific model name your transcription endpoint uses/expects (e.g., `Systran/faster-distil-whisper-large-v3`). Check your endpoint's requirements.
* `TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE`: *Optional.* The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format (e.g., `en` for English, `es` for Spanish) will improve transcription accuracy and latency. If not set, the transcription service will attempt to auto-detect the language.
* `OUTPUT_LANGUAGE`: *Optional.* The desired language for the generated titles, summaries, and chat responses (e.g., "English", "Spanish", "Chinese"). If not set, outputs will typically be in the language of the transcription or English. Ensure your chosen `TEXT_MODEL_NAME` supports the desired output language.
* `SECRET_KEY`: **Required.** A long, random string used by Flask for session security. The `setup.sh` script generates one if it's missing.
* `ALLOW_REGISTRATION`: *Optional.* Set to `false` to prevent new users from registering via the web UI. Defaults to `true`.

## Usage

1.  **Register/Login:** Access the web application via your browser. Register a new account (if enabled) or log in.
2.  **Upload:** Go to "New Recording" or drag-and-drop audio files onto the page. Upload progress and subsequent processing status will appear in the bottom-left popup.
3.  **View Recordings:** The main "Gallery" view lists your recordings, grouped by date. Click on a recording to view its details.
4.  **Interact:**
    * Listen to the audio using the player.
    * Read the transcription.
    * Review the AI-generated summary and title.
    * Read or edit metadata (participants, notes, meeting date). Use the small edit icons or the "Edit Details" button.
    * Use the "Chat with Transcript" panel to ask questions about the recording content.
5.  **Manage:** Edit details or delete recordings using the buttons in the detail view or the icons in the recording list.

## Admin Panel

* Accessible at `/admin` for logged-in admin users.
* **User Management:** View, add, edit (username, email, password, admin status), and delete users.
* **System Statistics:** View application-wide usage data.

## Database Management

The following scripts are located in the application root (`/opt/transcription-app` if deployed):

* `reset_db.py`: **Use with caution!** This script deletes the existing database (`instance/transcriptions.db`) and the contents of the `uploads` directory, then creates a fresh, empty database schema.
